go back to main screen when time ends
ring the ending timer when screen is shut down
smooth accordion open/closinga nimation
proper momentum to everything.
Make sure the ending bell stops when picking other bells - there is something sinister going on there
shuffle ambient sounds
perhaps try using an API to have M MORE sounds?
a flute for the app icon
slight fade in for ending bellss
slight fade in/out for ambience sounds when live meditating is there a fade in for the preview as well? Should use the same logic
